## How to use git
`git status` <--- Show the list of files which are modified in Red color, Green color one are those which are staged to be commited

`git add filename` <-- Moves the files from red to green so that they can be committed

`git commit -m "commit message like this is the solution to ppp chapter 5 exercise 1"`  <-- Commit the files as single commit with a meaningful message

`git push origin master` <-- Push the files to git so that everyone can see and modify

`git pull --rebase` <-- If push fails do this and then push again
